"In a complete system of simultaneous equations with $G$ endogenous variables, when the order condition for identification is $M-N_{i}<G-1$ ($M$ is the total number of endogenous variables and predetermined variables in the system of simultaneous equations, $N_{i}$ is the total number of endogenous variables and predetermined variables in the $i-th equation), it means ____.",The $i$th equation is exactly identified,The $i$th equation is not identifiable,The $i$th equation is overidentified,The $i$th equation has a unique statistical form,B,The $i$th equation is not identifiable
"Regarding the parameter estimation of the Probit model and the Logit model, the following statement is incorrect____.","When repeated observations are not available, the Logit model can use the iterative method used in the full information maximum likelihood method","When repeated observations are available, the two models can use the generalized least squares method","When repeated observations are not available, the two models can use the full information maximum likelihood method","In both cases where repeated observations are available and unavailable, both models must use the iterative method of full information maximum likelihood estimation",D,"In both cases where repeated observations are unavailable and available, both models use the iterative method of full information maximum likelihood estimation"
The elasticity of substitution of factors in the production function represents ____.,The ratio of the rate of change of the marginal rate of substitution of two factors to the rate of change of the ratio,"To maintain the sameoutput, if one unit of one factorinput is reduced, the quantity of another factorinput needs to be increased",The elasticity of substitution of factors is equal to $\frac{\mathrm{d}\ln(\frac{K}{L})}{\mathrm{d}\ln(\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}})}$,The elasticity of substitution of factors is the marginal rate of substitution of factors,C,The elasticity of factor substitution is equal to $\frac{\mathrm{d}\ln(\frac{K}{L})}{\mathrm{d}\ln(\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}})}$
"In a multiple linear regression model, if there is only multicollinearity, then ____.","Under complete collinearity, the parameter estimates can be obtained","Under approximate collinearity, the variance of the parameter estimates is minimal","Under approximate collinearity, the variance of the parameter estimates increases","New methods need to be developed to estimate the model, including ordinary least squares, difference method, etc.",D,"New methods need to be developed to estimate the model, including ordinary least squares method, difference method, etc."
